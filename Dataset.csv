 Kee u the great work..!,1
Satisfactory.,1
It was really a fantastic beginning. Loved learning comuter language. Without the hel of such an exerienced and knowledgeable instructor this course would have been difficult to understand and time consuming.,1
.,0
In lab the checking has to be done two times.so that if a student commits a mistake he can rectify it by next checking.,0
Sir taught good & course is imortant for those eole which branch related to this but sometimes sir doesn't care about the beginners.,1
I have learnt enough about this c language because of your teaching style.,1
The syllabus must be little different.,0
The course content was good and the instructor sir made us understand well. But the ace of the class was little high and a toic should be dealt in more detail in my oinion for better hold over that toic for all students.,1
It was very nice learning from you. You made sure that each and every toic was clear to us .,1
"Overall the course is definitely a good one. Because of the introduction of the course, I'm interested in learning more about C rogramming language. Thank you.",1
"sir,You can give some more time on some imortant toic like ointer,file management, structure,string.",0
Toics included are very useful and the way toics are discussed/taught in the class and lab are really good.But I request to teach little slower and to include simle assignments for students .,1
The course is so fast üò≠,0
More detailed teaching and daily basis assessment would be helful,0
It is useful to us,1
"It would have been better if there were more classes regarding the toics like structure, array ,ointer and recursion for the beginners..",0
"Felt like the teacher genuinely cared for the students' course knowledge, only that we could have been better students.",1
"Sir, it'll be more helful if you teach us slightly more slowly, because there are many beginners,and more detailing is needed..",0
"When considered as a course for novices to comuter I believe the instructor could have gone a bit more systematically about the curriculum . Very basic toics such as use and imortance , ros and cons of very rimitive statement such as I/O statements could have been exlain, also the concet of iteration should have been exlained in a more comrehensive way with more examles as it is one of the most imortant toics , also the concet if nested iteration was not covered uto the mark which is again very imortant toic . However when it comes to the efforts l and dedication of the mentor I believe he did everything he could to hel us learn the lesson and aid attention to every query asked by the students , also every ossible way to make the class more interactive was tried, so kudos to sir's sirit.",1
Enjoyed learning C.It was a good exerience,1
"Sir, you are good at teaching and slight back in concentration uon beginners.. We understanding concets but it is difficult to aly on rogram.. So hel to rectify these tye of roblems. Thank u sir.",0
"The way of teaching is very communicative, well structured and well delivered. As far as my exerience goes, I have never felt so intuitive after taking a class. The way you aroach is very good. The only drawback from my oint of view is that you focus more on some toics and give less effort on some like strings. Besides, I areciate the fact that you don't just reach out from exams oint of view. Also, let us enjoy more exciting roblems like Tower of Hanoi. Thank you for being such a great teacher.",0
Actually in my hs course I don't hv cs subject... that's y it is my beginning of this course.. I learnt a lot from the instructor.. his knowledge about this course is extremely good..bt he was too fast while teaching... that's it.,1
Theory sessions we're excellent... But in lab sessions instructor should focus on how to hel the beginners to exress the logic in seudo codes more recisely for the beginners before ractical assignments.,0
Going out of toic for some students disturbs our Concentration towards class (beginners so we can't understand),0
The teacher teaches really good . Just a bit fast coverage of toics . Would love to learn from him.,1
Overall good,1
Instructor is very dedicated in teaching so that any one can learn c. At 1st i don't even know what is coding (even rintf statement).i use to feel very inferior seeing remaining students doing so well in c.and when sir mentioned no one is suerior or inferior I'm very much encouraged to learn and after the end of the course now.I'm very confident that I learned all the basics in c .and i thank the instructor for his hard work.,1
Sir's effort was awesome. And we all secially I learn many things from sir.,1
Good,1
Course is good,1
That's was good,1
Sir you should care the beginner more and you should give assignment in ractical related to last theory class,1
Sir you should give related assignments in the lab which you have taught in the last theory class,0
"I think it would be more good if the instructor used a system to run rograms during exlanation so that it would be very helful to clarify many doubts then and there. We had many doubts only about syntax. This would even motivate students to learn things faster and easier. As many student had a myth of studying books rather than racticing on a comiler, this would be intriguing. It would be even better if we could get gcc in class.",0
It is good,1
"This course would be more better if the toics were taught ractically during class time. Overall, it was a helful course for all the beginners in C rogramming.",0
Teaching style is exelante and have a suortive nature.,1
"The ace of course was good at the beginning but as the toics rogressed the ace became fast . The toics at the mid and end of the course should have been given more time . In ractical sessions, the learning exerience would have been better if instructor gave some instructions about the roblems we are going to deal , rather then simly giving roblems to do on your own.",0
1. Starting months were a bit boring for those who were already exerienced in rogramming. A little different lans could have been made for them. 2. The main interaction in the class were from the students who were already exerienced in rogramming and the students new to this are still not engaged in the class. 3. It would be great if we would have been taught C++ instead of C. As nowadays C++ is used in most of the laces instead of C and also for the ease of understanding and better coding exerience.,0
"Sir, your teaching is really good.",1
Good but can be imroved betterüòÅüòÅ,1
"The course structure is nice, and taking the time constraints into consideration the teaching aroach and ace was good! Overall the course throughout the semester was u to the mark!",1
I could say that the instructor could slow down his ace so that students could understand the teachings better.,0
Nil,0
instructor does not know how to teach in a systematic way.,0
Awesome exerience,1
The course is really usuful for the beginners and our instructor was extremely good in addressing student's query and also solve them.,1
"Course is vast for the beginners, but the instructor is very active to his work and encourages everyone to be assionate to this subject. Overall, Sir is excellent!",1
Some extra care should be taken for the students who were not introduced to this course rior to this semester,0
Course is very imortant. The instructor behaviour is very good and teaching rocess is awesome,1
Instructor is good but there is a default in me,1
Good amount of outut based questions is discussed in ractical classes which must be made same for theory classes also,0
Sir is just awesome,1
The course was extremely useful and the Instructor was excellent,1
Both course and instructor are good but in,1
"The instructor has done an extremely good job in making us familiar with the coding world. I ersonally wasn't interested in coding, however now I want to learn more in this field. Thanks to our rofessor.",1
Our instructor focused a lot on the basics of every toic which was indeed very helful. The course should focus more on ractical alications of cometitive rogramming rather than theoretical questions,1
Nothing much,0
It was a comlete course for beginners.,1
"The course is great, but it's difficult to gras everything in such a limited amount of time.",0
"I appreciate the kind of questions given to us in labs since it helps us prepare for our interviews .But I would have preferred if we were given more idea on recursion (more practice on writing recursive codes since it is difficult). If emphasis on recursion is given then most of the data structures would become easier for the students. Also a genuine request that the markings for our lab to be done nicely because as compared to other sections , we get difficult questions and therefore aren't able to score so well . We on the other hand , will suffer while sitting for our internships because marks do matter for that cause . Thank you . I hope that you take this request into consideration .",0
"The course was great in almost all aspects. But I think the language used for teaching in lab should be C++, instead of C.",1
The course is very good,1
It's been a good semester,1
"Should focus more on problem solving(interview) rather than spending all the time teaching theories. Should be cooperative in bunks as we student *sometimes* really need some extra time for other vivas and internals, because *marks* is what all matters. Should be more lenient while checking copies, if some random section students get more marks than ours, some of us may be ineligible to sit in some campus interviews while other might just because of the fact the other teacher was less strict, because we as students (mostly) are here for jobs and there are plenty of rounds for checking our skills on DS or ALGO but just because we weren‚Äôt able to present our knowledge on paper won‚Äôt really matter. But MARKS do for us. The ones who really want to learn will learn somehow. Pressuring someone to do something in college will never work, a student will do what he wants to. Getting low marks may not be the realizing part but may become the depressing part. THANK YOU.",0
It was great learning experience,1
Important course with an engaging and understanding instructor,1
NUL,0
The course and the instructors team were really helpful,1
"The course is extremly important for our career, and debasis Sir has taught us how to approach a new problem and this really helps a lot, Thank you Sir",1
The discussion are mostly based on the concepts but discussion about the implementation of the concept (code ) would be more helpful,0
Can breif more in subject,0
No cmmnts,0
It Was very helpful. I got to learn a lot in the class.,1
It would be great if there were atleast a 2-3 minute break in the 2 hour class.,0
"Course extremely useful, instructor is very good",1
Good but quick,1
It was an excellent course delivered by the instructor in a very clear and concise manner.,1
Till the AVL tree the class discussion was good after that a bit faster and taught with less examples. But the explanation is really good sir.,1
The course is really interesting and knowledgeable and all thanks to sir for making it so easy for me to understand.,1
The Course is provided with all the important topics of data structure and algorithm. The instructor teaches with full clearance of the concept and without any psuedocode to help you improve your level of solving the problem.,1
"I think, even though the weightage of red black trees are less, explaining them after 2-4 trees and would have made red black more engaging to us as they sort of have a similatity among themselves.",0
Everything is so clear and fine about you teaching style. I like to say that students may feel better if you take two different classes instead of that continuously two hours class.,0
"I think this course is very important for every computer science undergraduate student , as it is just the beginning the computer course .",1
"Sir in my 10 + 2 curriculum there was no course of computers,so it was so difficult to me to follow the pace in my first year because introduction to computing was in my first semester.That fear of lagging behind haunted me continuously when I started my data structures too.My initial class test was a disaster and I didn't came to see my marks too.But by the time passing I developed myself and I scored 16 in my mid sem and I am able to complete my assignments in time on my own.Thanks for the sincere effort of yours. I only wish for some practice questions along with the topics other than the discussed ones in the class .",1
bad,0
"At times i felt like the classes were moving too fast , the students familiar with coding didnt face problems but for me i felt stuck and more the course piled up , more i hesitated in getting my doubts cleared .",0
"Respected sir, Somewhere course has gone very well But if I see the exam point of view.. My thought Is.. If class test would be see before mid sem or end sem it will be very useful about the pattern of checking.. While teacher checking the paper.. How will he checked? This will gave a idea to the students of paper checking pattern in future conducting midsem or endsem. Thank you sir And you are too good In your entire course.",1
I learned a lot and everything is great but it's hard to focus continuously in 2hr class,0
Everything is going great,1
"The course is too good but to get good command in programming(graphs,tress) it takes time.",1
"U r good at trees topic,i understand very clearly, i am unable catch linkedlist at very first classes.so i thought it should be thought after sometime class.",0
Very good.need extra class to teach about topics out of syllabus but very useful.,1
The instructor is very good in explaining everything. Please give some break between the continuos classes.,0
"Explaining the concepts with examples is very nice and easily understandable. At the starting of course i have felt it is fast but later it was ok.so i think at the starting of course you must take some more time as linked lists are basics,more precisely at double pointers.",0
Most of the things can be just gripped sitting in your class.,1
Provide 5 minutes break in 2 hour classes,0
well learned,1
"Sir,Please provide gate level questions weekly in PDF format to practice,on the covered topics.I am satisfied with your teachingüòäüòäüòä.",1
"Small advice I can give, the voice of the instructor should be loud enough during the lectures that even the students sitting in the last row who does not want to hear the lecture is compelled to hear.",0
Not a subject which the instructor should teach.,0
This course seems very useful as it gives idea to professionals what are ethicals to do and what we should avoid as an IT professional. Sometimes due to lack of these knowledge and rules we might get caught in adverse situation. Our instructor discussed every topic very simply which helped students to understand very easily. He cleared everyone's doubt and also tried to make us understand through some videos and examples. So overall the subject and teaching were very good.,1
The four years in this department were nice due to DM sir.,1
It was one of the best course i had during my B.Tech. I loved this course extremely it gave me so much motivation to work on explainable Machine learning and to know more and more about Data Science. Thank you so much sir for teaching this course to us.,1
The pace of the classes was a little slow which lead to some repetitive examples thereby curbing the interest. Also more assignments would have resulted in active participation from the students too!,0
Excellent course.,1
This course is really usefull Sir.and you are teaching it very well sir.,1
"I got to know about the importance of data in technology driven business, and how it can be used/mis-used, what future challenges is  technology facing, what can we do, and to think for solution to the problem. Overall it was wonderful experience to take such refreshing course. DM sir like always gave his 100% in making slides, content and made the subject fun and informative.",1
It would have been a perfection for each and every student if they had adequate amount of knowledge regarding data analysis and deep learning which could have been a cherry on the cake for the students.,0
You're one of the best instructors . I sometimes wonder how can you be so perfect .,1
Great sir best teacher in life !! Thanks,1
Machine learning can be included just the basics so it will be a win win thing for students.. thank you sir. :),1
"Nice initiative , some great topics i learned,which i thought every cs student must study. Hopefully it continue next year.Thank you so much sir for bringing this topic and you are the perfect instructor for this course. Hopefully in future i again love to take your classes.",1
The course was new & quite interesting. Beautifully explained by the Instructor.,1
The course could have been a little more compact.,0
Awesome teaching methodology!,1
The course was great. I have included all my comments in my exit feedback.,1
"The best instructor in the department (CS, IT combined).",1
This is something that definitely should be taught to IT students and the presentation of information was very clear and interesting,1
"The way sir taught this subject was really good.. Also this course, i think, plays an important role in any computer engineer's life.",1
No comments as such. Enjoyed the course.,1
It was an IT course to be proud of. Extremely useful in the final semester and who better than Mr DM sir to co-ordinate this. Thanks for everything Sir.,1
Really liked the course and the instructor but I expected to get something more than just Data Science which I didn't get.,1
This course clears the idea about the importance of ethical practice .....Thank you so much for teaching this subject .,1
Course was new but interesting,1
Very good,1
The instructor has good knowledge of the course.,1
"The instructor of the course is very proficient in even teaching a new subject which he's never taught before and he's very clear in his approach which shows he knows what he wants the students to learn and know. A very great initiative, I would say. The students are extremely happy as to be taught again by him before passing out which keeps the memories fresh. The course is very relevant in present times and is being taught very nicely. Just that I thought that the course is huge given the no. of classes. Some parts where a new concept is taught, I think the instructor should take a little bit more time to give us time to digest the terms and facts. Saying this, I am very glad to have taken this course and I would also recommend this to the next batch cause that's the most ""Ethical"" thing to do!!",1
This subject wants me to explore things by myself and I personally think this subject can be offered in 6 or 7th sem.,0
DM sir is just one of the best instructors out there.,1
Course could have been made more engaging by adding relevant videos on ethics,0
good,1
I would like our instruction to add practical problems related to fairness in model by giving dataset and ask students train their model. Students should be asked to evaluate their results as per metrics taught in the course.,0
"The course is really insightful and covers hidden side of our work. Since the general motive is to make us understand and develop a perspective about things, covering less topics in a class is better because after a certain point the attention/interest decreases. It was a very interesting course. Thanks a lot!",1
The material provided is according to me needs to have much more data,0
"This course has been pretty engaging as it needed to both learn and think about the situations while being on research. Being computer professionals, it will also help us in applying the learnings in real life.",1
Please try to make it more lively.,0
The course is really good and the way of teaching was extremely good.,1
This course was easy to understand as well as very useful for near future,1
Nothing,0
Everything is good but the subject seems a bit less interesting.,0
I really liked the course material and I believe more courses like this should be a part of our curriculum.,1
The course and instructor both were fine.,1
Through this course i came across many interesting facts. I learnt so many new topics through the references provided in this course and while going through them i really felt very much interesting.,1
"I have been looking forward to this course since the very beginning of the semester. I have felt very engaged to this course. And it was all because of the course material, the way you've taught us so efficiently and whole heartedly. Thank you so much sir.",1
It was good,1
"Thank you Sir for offering this course. This was one of the best courses in our entire B.Tech Program and being offered by you made it so much interesting and a pleasure to attend. Each of the topics covered in this course are so much relevant today. I feel this course is so updated and relevant that it ought to be a compulsory course rather than an elective. Also, sir i would like to thank you for all the great slides and YouTube videos. We all could see how much effort you had put into making this course interesting and fun for us. I sincerely apologise that we didn't give back the same dedication from our end but I'm sure most of us understood the message you wanted to convey by offering this course. It certainly opened our eyes to thinking ethically, something which we never even considered in our line of profession.",1
The course is very relevant in this day and age and course material was well presented. Due to the unforeseeable circumstances the classes was abruptly halted and that somewhat deprived us of the face to face communication needed in such subjects. Otherwise I thought this was a great course with perfect course material and helpful instructor,1
"This course is definitely one of the best courses our B.Tech program has offered. While doing the classes and also, due to the search we did to complete our assignments, I came across many interesting topics. I really loved it. Thank you sir for being such an amazing teacher.",1
"I found this course very interesting and important for a computer science student, as each topic relates to some or the other global issue that is being ly addressed around the world. In the light of the recent events , I was able to relate to so many different things such as how racism is breeds in our daily life and how privacy though may not seem concerning but can damage us badly and how AI can lead to dangerous world. And i would like to thank sir for proving us with appropriate and interesting content with the help of videos and different research papers which made the topic extremely interesting.",1
Write your comments and/or concerns about the course and the instructor.,0
I feel the course structure is very good but somewhat it is unable to connect to students. I strongly believe that the presentation of the lectures should be improved to make it more engaging.,0
This was perhaps one of the most interesting course that i attended in 4 years.,1
Very important subject for all people of this gemeration,1
"No one professor can care on addressing these ethics. As, entering in a profession we guys must have some basic knowledge on this. Because of you we gained somehow better not excellent because of covid-19. Thanks for your impaccable struggle towards students. Hope you will continue this subject on upcoming batches also. Thanks for everything sir.",1
A very useful course for freshers who will be working in the industry to know how they can create impact in the society.,1
No such concerns,0
Must have subject with the perfect instructor assigned to it.,1
Thankyou for the presentation as well as the lectures on youtube and for making the subject interesting.,1
The course is a breath of fresh air amidst the age old courses. I had immense fun .,1
"I personally appreciate the various scenarios that were presented to us from time to time, so that we could do some thinking of our own and analyse the situation under the norms of computer ethics.",1
This subject is really very important to each and everyone not only for CSE/IT students but for all. And I think we(our batch) are very lucky that you tought this subject to us because no one can be better than you to clear any topic or subject.,1
No concerns. Great course!,1
"It was nice to have one class with you at the very end of our college life. Have always loved your teaching, starting from the DS class. This class too, though not many classes offline, but I'll remember the way we engaged on that cake cutting problem during this time and also the other classes. Thank you for everything.",1
During the start of the course I thought this is unnecessary but the course is engaging and fun. It‚Äôs good to know more about ethics.,1
The course was adequate for the students in the final semester of their study.,1
Very much needed course,1
I'm glad I took this course,1

Regular tests and quizzes can help.,1
"1.)The course structure is too wide to be completed in just 1 semester,so for proper understanding and for grabbing the concepts of data structures and algorithms, the course should be divided in two semester. 2.) The instructors were awesome but the pace at which the course has been completed is too fast and it was very difficult for me to understand many of the topics taught in class. 3.)I am ly facing problem at how much time I should give to competitive programming,and ly doing and improving CP is really an issue for me .So,it will be great if you can help me out in CP. 4.)The instructors present during our class were awesome especially the instructor who used to give us tutorial class before the lab.",0
"DS can be best understood with Smart Classes,Smart classes should happen sometimes like presentation etc. Thank you",0
Do clear all our doubts and help us become a good coder. Arrange smart class facilities in DS class so that we may understand the topic more clearly. Thank you,0
"It would be good ,If questions pattern were discussed in the class for exam.",0
Reduce the pace and use the board before the explanation so that we will aware of that before illustration,0
It was a nice experience being taught by you,1

Very friendly and extremely engaging,1
Good teacher. Gives good marks too.,1
"As far as this subject is concerned, according to my opinion, everything is alright. Professor and subject, both are nice. I would request to kindly take feedback for algorithm design and analysis also. Students are willing to provide feedback for it. What we understand in class is just NOTHING in SM sir's class.",1
The COA lab is not related to what we are being taught in the class. So what is the use of COA lab?,0
Very good learning experience.,1
This subject is a bit tough to understand but the way you teach makes it easier,1

Everything is pretty good. Sir can you tell us about the projects that students can do on this topic in introductory class,1
The instructor should show some kind of presentation/practical so that our concept can be clarified easily.,0
This course is extremely useful from a future Hardware designer's perspective,1
The concerned Lab of this subject had not much usefulness and relation with this subject. It would be better if we get to implement or see the application of the subject in the lab.,0
If possible then please first make the diagram then ellaborate the topic.,0

"1.)If assignments would have been given ,then I would have understood the concept more thoroughly. 2.)One more thing I want to say is about lab , although all the instructors were really helpful and they explained us every experiment and cleared all our doubts but the problem is in number of students alloted in each group .i.e per breadboard. In lab we were divided in groups of 6-7 students each and so only one person who knew about experiment did all the experiments and rests stand for all the time so this was not useful as many of us were not able to do a single experiment by themselves. Because this many of the students don't know how to make different circuits using breadboard because only the one who knew does all the experiments. So ,sir it would be really helpful if from next lab we are allocated max 2-3 students per breadboard. Thankyou.",0
Sir you are the best professor of IT.Please forgive us for all the mistakes we have done.Just one addition in this comment....If you kindly give us time to write down the explanation(the portion which you do not write in board) of every topic then there will be no book in the market which will be better than our class note.,1
The course would have been much more clearer if the topics in lab were more related to the topics taught in class.,0
